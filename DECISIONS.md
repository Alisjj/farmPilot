# Rebuild Decisions (design-v1)

Date: 2025-08-22

This file records the immediate technical choices for the rebuild aligned with `design.md`.

1) Migration/ORM
  - Chosen: Drizzle ORM (TypeScript-first). Reason: repository contains `drizzle.config.ts` and the codebase is TypeScript; reusing Drizzle avoids adding a new toolchain.

2) Database
  - PostgreSQL (managed/provisioned in production). Local dev will use Docker Compose Postgres.

3) Backend
  - Node.js + Express (aligns with design). Use TypeScript, JWT for auth, Joi for request validation.

4) Frontend
  - React + Material UI. PWA-ready via Vite (existing client uses Vite).

5) Testing
  - Unit: Vitest (backend + frontend where appropriate)
  - E2E: Cypress (already present)

6) Dev infra
  - Add `docker-compose.dev.yml` for Postgres and a placeholder app service
  - Provide `.env.example` for required env vars

Notes:
- If you want to switch to Prisma instead, we can migrate schema later â€” but initial work will continue with Drizzle.
