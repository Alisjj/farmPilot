# Rebuild Plan â€” Align Implementation to Design v1.0

Date: 2025-08-24  
**Last Updated:** 2025-08-24

Objective: Rebuild according to `design.md` while preserving the existing repository/file architecture and reusing existing libraries and UI where possible. The `legacy/` folder contains the previous `client/` and `server/` layouts â€” use that as the reference for components, pages, shared types, and styles. Only scrap or rewrite code when necessary to implement the new design or remove technical debt.

---

## Requirements coverage

- Use the current design (design.md) as the single source of truth
- Scrap current implementation (archive/disable old code paths)
- Provide a clear, trackable task list in Markdown

Status key: [P0]=Critical, [P1]=High, [P2]=Normal | [ðŸŸ¢]=Done [ðŸŸ¡]=In-Progress [âšª]=Todo

## Phase 0 â€” Preparation & Reset

- [P0][ðŸŸ¢] Create rebuild branch `rebuild/design-v1` and protect `main`
- [P0][ðŸŸ¢] Snapshot current repo: tag `pre-rebuild-<date>` and archive `client/` + `server/` to `legacy/`
- [P0][ðŸŸ¢] Keep only infra that still helps (Cypress, Tailwind config if reused, CI); note deviations in this doc
- [P0][ðŸŸ¢] Decide lib choices that must match design (prefer existing libs from `legacy/`):
  - Backend: Node.js + Express, JWT, Zod (upgraded from Joi for better TypeScript integration)
  - DB: PostgreSQL, migrations (Drizzle ORM as configured in existing setup)
  - Frontend: React + Material UI, Chart.js, PWA (reuse components and styles from `legacy/client`)

### Running tests against a real Postgres database (optional)

- Set up a local or CI Postgres and create a test database (example name: `farmpilot_test`).
- Set the env var `DATABASE_URL` to the test DB connection string.
- To run the Jest suite against the real DB and apply migrations automatically, set `TEST_REAL_DB=true` and run the server tests from the repo root:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:pass@localhost/farmpilot_test TEST_REAL_DB=true pnpm --filter ./server test
```

- The test setup will attempt to apply SQL files from the top-level `migrations/` directory before running tests. Prefer a dedicated test DB to avoid data loss.

If you prefer isolated tests without a DB, the test-suite already uses an in-process mock DB by default.

## Risks & Mitigations

- **âœ… Authentication complexity** â†’ Completed with comprehensive testing
- **âœ… Code organization debt** â†’ Resolved with convention cleanup
- **ðŸ”„ Labor cost integration complexity** â†’ Document algorithms clearly; make configurable
- Offline sync complexity â†’ start with simple queue, no merges; warn on conflicts
- Performance regressions â†’ add indices early; profile slow queries
- Scope creep â†’ lock design v1.0; change via explicit RFCs

---

## Working Agreements

- API and schema changes require updating `design.md` and migrations in the same PR
- Keep TypeScript types in `shared/` for API contracts (DTOs)
- Add tests with features; do not merge red builds
- **NEW:** Follow established naming conventions (kebab-case for files, clear describe blocks)
- **NEW:** Maintain centralized exports for clean import patterns
