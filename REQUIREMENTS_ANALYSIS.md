# Poultry Farm Management System - Requirements Analysis & Implementation Status

## üìå Executive Summary (Updated Aug 9, 2025)

The codebase has progressed beyond the earlier gap list. Core data structures and many backend endpoints now exist for activities, alerts, inventory, suppliers, employees, finance, health, and production. Several advanced/analytics/security features remain partial or unimplemented. This document reflects the CURRENT STATE and defines the focused backlog.

---

## ‚úÖ Implemented (Foundational)

-   Authentication: JWT + refresh tokens, role model, lockout fields
-   Users: CRUD helpers
-   Activities: Extended schema (status, priority, farmSection, weather*, reviewer*, JSON data), metrics & summary endpoints
-   Alerts: Threshold & alert tables, basic generation for mortality & production placeholders; list & mark-read endpoints
-   Inventory & Suppliers: Tables + CRUD + low stock + expiring queries
-   Employees: Structured profiles (basic), unique ID generation, CRUD
-   Financial Transactions: Table + CRUD + date range + type filtering
-   Health Records: Table + endpoints + simple recent ‚Äúalert‚Äù filter
-   Production Data: Table + today/range endpoints
-   KPI / Reporting Scaffolding: Tables for KPI summaries, trends, report templates/runs, dashboard configurations (no active logic yet)
-   Dashboard metrics aggregation (basic)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial

-   Activity-specific frontend forms (only EggCollection & Mortality present)
-   Validation schemas (not all implemented client/server)
-   Alert logic (only simple thresholds; no trend analytics, no scheduling)
-   Weather capture (schema fields exist; no integration/service)
-   Metrics/trends (placeholder values returned)
-   Inventory consumption linkage (activities do not auto-deduct stock)
-   Health/veterinary workflows (no appointments, compliance, anomaly detection)
-   Financial domain (no procurement workflow, budgeting, payroll)
-   Reporting (no export API, no scheduled generation, no PDF/CSV logic)
-   Security (no MFA, no audit/event log, no session concurrency checks, no encryption at rest strategy)
-   KPI/BI (tables unused by routes; no executive dashboard assembling KPIs)
-   Advanced HR (no attendance, scheduling, leave, performance reviews, training records, document store)

## ‚ùå Missing

-   Procurement (purchase orders, supplier performance analytics)
-   Payroll & salary processing, pay periods, pay stubs
-   Automated report scheduling & delivery
-   Export (CSV/Excel/PDF) endpoints
-   Alert delivery channels (email/SMS) & notification preferences
-   Audit logging & security event pipeline
-   MFA (TOTP / WebAuthn)
-   Data encryption at rest policy & key management (beyond DB defaults)
-   Advanced analytics calculations (FCR, mortality %, productivity, feed efficiency) automated
-   Veterinary appointments & treatment scheduling
-   Regulatory compliance (withdrawal period enforcement, audit trails)
-   Real inventory batch/lot tracking & consumption posting from activities
-   Dashboard customization (using dashboard_configurations) UI & APIs
-   Background jobs / scheduler for KPI rollups & report generation
-   Mobile-optimized reporting views
-   Robust automated test coverage (unit + e2e for new modules)
